# bots

Welcome to my exciting project!

## About Me

Hey there! I'm Probrav, a passionate developer with big dreams. I'm thrilled to embark on this journey to create something amazing. Let me share with you my plans for this project.

## Project Description

This project aims to create a number of useful bots. It will be used for various purposes. I plan to develop it using Python and bash to ensure a robust and efficient solution.

## Features

Here are some of the features I have in mind:

- [bots for monitoring]: I want to implement it into binding with an alert manager
- [bot for replacing the human routine actions on a telegram channel]: It would be great to have a applications sorter, collector and acceptor, FAQ answering-machine.
- [AI features]: Additionally, I plan to include AI API into the code

These are just initial ideas, and as the project progresses, I may come up with more exciting features to enhance its functionality.

## Roadmap

Here's a rough roadmap of my development plan:

1. **Planning Phase**: In this phase, I will brainstorm ideas, gather requirements, and create a detailed project plan.
2. **Development**: I will start implementing the core functionalities of the project, focusing on alg.structure and code.
3. **Testing and Refinement**: Once the initial development is complete, I will thoroughly test the project, identify bugs or issues, and refine the codebase.
4. **User Feedback and Iteration**: I highly value user feedback. I will release an early version for users to test and provide feedback, allowing me to make necessary improvements and iterate on the project.
5. **Polishing and Documentation**: I believe in delivering a polished product. I will work on refining the user interface, optimizing performance, and creating comprehensive documentation to help users understand and utilize the project effectively.
6. **Release**: Finally, I will sell the stable and more succeded bots :) And continue developing

Please note that this roadmap is subject to change as new ideas emerge and challenges arise during the development process.
